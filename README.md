# API Sample Test

## Getting Started

This project requires a newer version of Node. Don't forget to install the NPM packages afterwards.

You should change the name of the ```.env.example``` file to ```.env```.

Run ```node app.js``` to get things started. Hopefully the project should start without any errors.

## Explanations

The actual task will be explained separately.

This is a very simple project that pulls data from HubSpot's CRM API. It pulls and processes company and contact data from HubSpot but does not insert it into the database.

In HubSpot, contacts can be part of companies. HubSpot calls this relationship an association. That is, a contact has an association with a company. We make a separate call when processing contacts to fetch this association data.

The Domain model is a record signifying a HockeyStack customer. You shouldn't worry about the actual implementation of it. The only important property is the ```hubspot```object in ```integrations```. This is how we know which HubSpot instance to connect to.

The implementation of the server and the ```server.js``` is not important for this project.

Every data source in this project was created for test purposes. If any request takes more than 5 seconds to execute, there is something wrong with the implementation.
